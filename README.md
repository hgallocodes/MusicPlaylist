This project involved developing a music management system in Java that allows users to store, organize, and recommend songs efficiently. Leveraging data structures like hashtables and treemaps, the system categorizes songs by name and artist while supporting scalable data imports from CSV files. A recommendation engine analyzes user listening habits and song attributes to provide personalized suggestions. Object-oriented design principles were applied, creating modular PlayableItem objects for song comparison based on duration and popularity. The project integrated file I/O, data parsing, and recommendation algorithms for seamless user experience in playlist management and song recommendations.
